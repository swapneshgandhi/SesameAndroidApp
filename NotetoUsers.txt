Sesame is an app which lets you access web services such as gmail, ubmail etc. on your pc without having to enter the password every single time.

SesameClient is an android app which connects to SesameServer running on PC via Bluetooth. 

So for sesame to work you need to pair two devices via bluetooth before you can use SesameClient.

If you face any issues e.g. app crashing etc. it's most likely because phone isn't connected to the the PC.

FYI, On Mac- to connect to bluetooth you may need to enable Tethering on your android phone.So, if tethering is not enable Mac will not let you connect to bluetooth.

user instructions after installing the app.
1. When you use sesame app for the first time, you need to create the pattern, you will need to enter the pattern every time to access any sesame services.
2. then the app will ask you to connect to the pc. Phone must be 'paired and connected' with the pc for this step to work.

3. Then it would take you to list of accounts, as you don't have any accounts set up yet initially,
First goto setup accounts button on upper right corner of the screen (it's actually a button with three dots) and set up an account e.g. (gmail) after setting it up..you can click on Open button and if server was working, it would open up a new window and enter your credentials. 
So now, you can access the website.
